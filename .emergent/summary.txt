The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack dashboard application with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, adhering to user-specified Red Dead Redemption 2 aesthetics. The development followed an iterative approach, focusing on two main modules: Hunter and Map. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, promptly addressing bugs and implementing new features based on continuous user feedback. Key aspects included robust authentication, role-based access control for administrative features, complex logic for item calculators, and an interactive, draggable, and zoomable map with custom markers. The engineer was highly responsive to UI/UX feedback, refining layouts, adding custom dialogs, and applying thematic textures, always ensuring the application met the detailed and evolving product requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a dashboard application featuring Hunter, Map, and Zug sections, with a user login system and data stored in MongoDB. The application needs admin functionality for managing user accounts (create, delete, edit) and permissions. Users should have a profile tab to change passwords.

The Hunter section requires:
1.  **Item Calculator**: Calculates total price based on packages, with tiered pricing (0 base, 7 for 5+ packages, 5 for 10+ packages).
2.  **Crafting Calculator**: Determines materials needed for a given number of packages (50x bratwurst, 50x dosenwurst per package, with specific crafting recipes for each).
3.  **Inventory List**: Display items with prices, a field for quantity to calculate live total price, and functionality to add/edit items and adjust stock.
4.  **Log**: List stock changes, noting which user performed the action, with a Personal Use (Eigenbedarf) option.
5.  **Sales Calculator**: Allows users to select items, specify quantities, view total price, and deduct items from stock upon sale.

The Map section requires:
1.  **Interactive Map**: Display a Red Dead Redemption 2 map image.
2.  **Marker Management**: Right-click to place a marker with name, type (person, building, purchase, dismantle), and friendly status (displayed in red if not friendly). Right-click on existing markers to edit.
3.  **Navigation**: Zoom with mouse wheel (zooming to cursor) and drag functionality.
4.  **Visuals**: Specific marker colors (blue for person, green for building, yellow for purchase, orange for dismantle). Fixed marker size with hover-to-enlarge effect. Labels to the right of markers, also triggering hover. Map centered on load.

General requirements:
*   Aesthetic: Inspired by Red Dead Redemption 2 (map colors, beige parchment paper, custom dialogs).
*   UI/UX: Navbar to remain visible, no unwanted scrolling, full screen map, clear input labels.
*   Authentication: Simple username/password login.
*   Permissions: Initially, only admins could edit stock and delete log entries; later, non-admins could adjust stock (add/remove) and use the Personal Use checkbox. Map interaction (create/edit markers, view legend) is also for all users.
*   A Back to Dashboard button on every page, preferably in the left sidebar/navbar.

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate the Zug (Train) section.
- Implement the detailed functionality for the Map section that allows editing existing markers via right-click (currently, right-click seems to only open the new marker form).
- Implement the friendly marker display as a red text.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving a critical layout and visibility issue with the interactive map in the Map section. The user reported that the map was cut off from the top, specifically around the area where the legend should be, and provided a screenshot confirming this.

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Initial Assessment**: The engineer first checked the height calculation () in  and measured the navbar's actual height, correcting it to . This attempt partially resolved some height issues but not the cutoff.
2.  **Root Cause Identification**: The core problem was identified in . The map was rendered within a  container that had a gradient background and seemed to be causing the map to start below its intended position, leading to the cutoff at the top.
3.  **Correction**: The engineer edited  to adjust how the main content area (where the  is rendered) is styled. Specifically, classes related to  and  were modified or removed from the container holding the main content, and a  was introduced to compensate for a border, ensuring the map starts precisely below the fixed navbar.

The last message indicates that this issue has been successfully resolved, and the map is now fully visible, correctly positioned below the navbar, without any cutoff or unwanted scrollbars.

<optional_next_step>
I will now address the remaining pending tasks for the Map section, specifically ensuring existing markers can be edited via right-click and implementing the red text for unfriendly marker display.
